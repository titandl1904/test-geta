TASK 2

SOLUTIONS
In my opinion, we need to redesign this layout to adapt for mobile and tablet design
- Menu for Dashboard > Main > Home should be change to hamburger menu, search button, input should in the bottom of hamburder menu.
The hamburger menu should be always in the top when user scroll down
- The menu under menu right (Welcome Peldi - History - ...) should be inside hamburger menu
- we should change the left menu (Page operations, browse space, add content) to button and stay on the top, so user can switch these page by click this each button
- Content inside Main we need to handle responsive to make sure the image will responsive
- Add button to scroll up

BEST PRACTICE
- If we need to increase load time, in Front end we need to use image srcset and Backeend will crop image for each resolution:
  + Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up)
  + Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)
  + Large devices (desktops, 992px and up)
  + Extra large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up)

to make sure we don't load the big image in mobile device.
Use lazy load to load image

- If we already have the website but this website didn't responsive, we can style for large desktops > desktops > tablets > phones
- If we start project, we can use mobile first
- Don't seperate too much media-breakpoint if unneeded
- Don't use too much CSS3 if we need to support old browser (flex, grid, animation ...)
